# F-Droid

This repository hosts a [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) repo for my apps.
This repository allows you to get the latest and greatest
app updates faster than the app stores.

## How to use

1. First, you should install [**Droid-ify**](https://github.com/Droid-ify/client),
   a modern F-Droid client with Material UI design.
   You can download it from:

   - [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.looker.droidify/)
   - [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Droid-ify/client/releases)

2. In the Droid-ify app, navigate to Settings > Repositories.

3. Click the + floating action button to add a new repository.

4. Click _SCAN QR CODE_ and scan the QR below:

   <p align="center">
     <img src=".github/qrcode.png?raw=true" alt="F-Droid repo QR code" style="width:500px;height:500px;"/>
   </p>

   Alternatively, you can also add the repository manually with the following URL:

   ```txt
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xpos587/fdroid/main/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=93D7D47A5E0E66C17C24710DC563FA2E54DAA7883384199B1845FB2D6E0EEBADD
   ```

5. You can now install my apps, e.g. start by searching for "WG Tunnel" or "v2rayNG"
   in the Droid-ify client.

Please note that some apps published here might contain [Anti-Features](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Anti-Features/).
If you can't find an app by searching for it, you can go to
settings and enable "Include anti-feature apps".
